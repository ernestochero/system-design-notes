# System Design Roadmap – Study Notes

A structured, 8-week journey to master System Design with hands‑on designs, notes, and diagrams.

## Structure
- `docs/weeks/` – weekly notes & exercises
- `docs/designs/` – full HLD case studies (Bitly, WhatsApp, Twitter Feed, Search Autocomplete)
- `docs/snippets/` – reusable code/queries
- `templates/` – design & interview templates
- `docs/resources/` – curated links & summaries

## Weekly Flow
1. Read core concepts.
2. Draft a design using the template.
3. Draw a diagram (Mermaid suggested).
4. Write trade-offs & scaling plan.
5. Do a short retrospective: “what I’d improve”.
